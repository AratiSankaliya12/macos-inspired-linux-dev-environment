# MacOS-Inspired Linux Developer Environment 💻

Most people customize Linux. Very few engineer it.

This project shows how I designed a macOS-inspired Ubuntu developer environment by making deliberate trade-offs between performance, stability, UX, and system safety.

## 🎯 Why This Project?

Instead of random customization, I asked:

- How can Linux feel premium without becoming fragile?
- How can modern CLI tools safely replace legacy commands?
- How can customization coexist with performance and recovery?

## 🛠️ What I Built

**Terminal & Workflow**
- ZSH + Oh-My-Zsh with Starship prompt
- Autosuggestions, syntax highlighting, completions
- Custom aliases, functions, and startup identity message

**Modern CLI Toolchain**
- `exa` → improved `ls`
- `bat` → syntax-highlighted `cat`
- `fd` → fast file search
- `ripgrep` → high-performance text search

**System UI Components Used**
- **GTK Theme**: WhiteSur GTK for macOS-style window design, Rounded corners, left-side window controls
- **Icon Theme**: WhiteSur icon theme for consistent application icons
- **Cursor Theme**: Capitaine cursors for polished pointer aesthetics
- **Dock & Window Behavior**: Dash-to-Dock configured for macOS-like behavior
- **Fonts**: San Francisco Pro–inspired fonts for visual consistency
- **Shell & Visual Enhancements**: Blur and transparency applied only where performance-safe (GNOME top bar)

**Safety & Reliability**
- TimeShift snapshots
- Custom dotfile backup scripts
- External drive backups

## ⚙️ Design Principles

- Performance first (avoided heavy GNOME extensions)
- Stability over novelty
- Reproducible setup via versioned dotfiles
- Backups before and after system changes

---

## 🚀 Performance Highlights

- Boot time optimized to ~20 seconds
- Boot pipeline optimized (GRUB + systemd) for single-OS startup
- Startup services audited with `systemd-analyze`
- Login delay measured and corrected after GDM customization

---

## 🧠 Trade-offs & Decisions

- Skipped QuickLook due to GNOME 46 limitations
- Avoided heavy animation extensions
- Prioritized speed and stability over visual gimmicks

---

## 🧩 Skills Demonstrated

- Linux system internals
- Shell scripting (Bash/ZSH)
- Performance profiling & optimization
- UX-driven system design
- Configuration management & documentation
